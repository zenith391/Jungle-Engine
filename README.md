Jungle Engine is a 3D engine for Java mostly used privately for Cubz and other 3D projects.

**Dependencies** (better to configure with Maven):

All of theses assets can be found on [LWJGL 3 website](https://www.lwjgl.org/customize) (except pngdecoder which can be found on Maven central repo)

Later version of libraries can be used, but not their new features to keep backward compatibility.
